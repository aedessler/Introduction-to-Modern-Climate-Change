    "Summing over all wavelengths, the amount of energy emitted by a blackbody is equal to $\\sigma T^4$.  Thus, as the temperature goes up, the total amount of energy emitted by the blackbody also goes up rapidly.  This could have been seen in the example above as the rapid rescaling of the y-axis as the temperature changed.  This can be seen more clearly in the left-hand plot of the following example, where I have fixed the axes so that change in emission energy becomes readily apparent.  The eagle-eyed observer will also see the slight shift of the peak of the emission spectrum to the left as the temperature increases.  In the right-hand plot, the total energy emitted by the blackbody is plotted as a function of temperature. "
